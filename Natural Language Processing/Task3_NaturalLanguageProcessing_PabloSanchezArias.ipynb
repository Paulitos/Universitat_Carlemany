        "The above implementation should provide the accuracy of the classifier on the test set.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Potential Challenges and Discussion\n",
        "1. **Small Training Data**: The performance may be low due to a small training dataset. More labeled examples would improve the classifier's accuracy.\n",
        "2. **Feature Selection**: The choice of features (neighboring words, POS tags, etc.) greatly impacts the model's performance. Experimenting with different features and their combinations can help improve results.\n",
        "3. **Context Window**: The size of the context window around the ambiguous word is crucial. Too small a window might miss important context, while too large a window might introduce noise.\n",
        "4. **Ambiguity in Training Data**: Ambiguities or errors in the training data annotations can negatively affect the classifier's performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, feature-based WSD can effectively disambiguate words with multiple senses by leveraging contextual information, although it requires a good amount of labeled data and thoughtful feature engineering to achieve high accuracy."

        "\n",
        "The Lesk Algorithm performed successfully for all the given sentences, accurately identifying the correct sense of the ambiguous words based on context.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Successes:\n",
        "- **Clear Context**: The algorithm worked well when the context provided clear and distinctive words related to the glosses of the senses. For example, words like \"note\" and \"played\" in the sentence \"He played a deep note on the bass\" clearly point towards the musical instrument sense of \"bass\".\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Challenges:\n",
        "- **Limited Gloss Information**: The algorithm's performance heavily depends on the quality and comprehensiveness of the glosses. Simplified glosses might miss important contextual clues.\n",
        "- **Polysemy and Context Overlap**: In cases where senses have overlapping context or the context itself is ambiguous, the algorithm might struggle. For instance, \"spring\" as a season and \"spring\" as a coil might overlap in contexts where temporal and mechanical senses are both possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Improvements:\n",
        "- **Enhanced Contextual Understanding**: Integrating more advanced natural language processing techniques, such as word embeddings or contextual embeddings (e.g., BERT), can provide richer context representations.\n",
        "- **Expanded Glosses**: Using more detailed glosses from comprehensive dictionaries or thesauruses can help improve the algorithm's accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, while the Lesk Algorithm is a simple and effective method for word sense disambiguation, especially with well-defined and non-overlapping contexts, its effectiveness can be improved by enhancing the richness of glosses and employing more sophisticated contextual analysis techniques.\n",
